# Spotify Analysis

Spotify allows every user to request a download of all their streaming history, so Part A of this project is completely dependent on that. They also have an amazing Developer Platform in which the public can use the data available for their own interest. 
Using this, I aim to visualise the data to get a better understanding of the follow: 

* Timeline of my streaming history
* Day preference
* Favorite artist
* Favorite songs
* Spirit of the songs
* Diversity

 I also used the audio features option — which breaks down a song and gives it ‘score’ for a number of different attributes. The attributes are as follows:
* Acousticness — A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic
* Danceability — A description of how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
* Energy — Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
* Instrumentalness — Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
* Liveness — Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
* Loudness — The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
* Speechiness — Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
* Valence — A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
* Tempo — The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration
* Mode — Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
* Key — The estimated overall key of the track.

Part B is a comparison of my music choice with the world's, for which I used this dataset from Kaggle.
